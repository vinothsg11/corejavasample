#Two types fo exception
-> Checked Exception
    ->  A checked exception is an exception that occurs at the compile time, these are also called as compile time exceptions.
    -> These exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation, the Programmer should take care of (handle) these exceptions.
-> un checked exception
    -> An Unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution, these are also called as Runtime Exceptions,
    -> these include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.
-> Errors
    -> These are not exceptions at all, but problems that arise beyond the control of the user or the programmer.
    -> Errors are typically ignored in your code because you can rarely do anything about an error. For example,
     -> if a stack overflow occurs, an error will arise. They are also ignored at the time of compilation.

-> Heirarchy
->  java.lang ->
    Object ->
    Throwable ->
     -> Errors
     -> Excetions
        -> Runtime Exception
        -> Other Exception
