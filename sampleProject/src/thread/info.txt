What is thread?
Java is a multi threaded programming language which means we can develop multi threaded program using Java. A multi threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently and each part can handle different task at the same time making optimal use of the available resources specially when your computer has multiple CPUs.

By definition multitasking is when multiple processes share common processing resources such as a CPU. Multi threading extends the idea of multitasking into applications where you can subdivide specific operations within a single application into individual threads. Each of the threads can run in parallel. The OS divides processing time not only among different applications, but also among each thread within an application.

Multi threading enables you to write in a way where multiple activities can proceed concurrently in the same program.

Life Cycle Of Thread
========================
-> New -> Runnable -> Running -> Waiting -> Dead
    |                     |
   Dead                 Dead

Thread Priority
=================
MIN_PRIORIT
MAX_PRIORITY
NORM_PRIORITY

-> Creat Thread by implementing Runnable Interface
    -> run()


* Synchronization
===============
